# Equity-Portfolio-Management-and-Valuation-Platform

This is the project of the C++ class during my master studies of quantitative finance. I did this project along with Tianjie Ma,  Niclas Dombrowski and Yantai Wang at Fordham University. I am very proud of being part of this team. This project wouldn't be accomplished without any of us.
